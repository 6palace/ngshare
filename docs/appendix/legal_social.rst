Legal & Social Aspects
======================
Our project will be delivered in a way that does not involve deployment on our (the developerâ€™s) side, so the users are responsible for deploying the project and setting up terms and conditions regarding their use of our project and collecting their user data.

Our project will be an extension on an existing open source project. The existing project is using the BSD license, which allows anyone to use and modify the software. The open source license disclaims all warranties, so there is not much we can say about the social and legal aspect of the product.

Our project will make a social impact on all current nbgrader users and possibly IT service providers for programming courses. Our project makes it possible to have centralized kubernetes or other container clusters maintained by IT service providers and used by individual programming class instructors. This feature may also let nbgrader be more popular.
